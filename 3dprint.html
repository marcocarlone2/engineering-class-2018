<p>Our class also made 3D printable models. We were able to do this using tools like Autodesk Inventor which we created 3D shapes and parts which are compatible with our 3D printer. After we made these shapes we took them from a Flash drive to the printer and were able to print out our models. Even though they were small it took a a long time and we were able to see the price of how much our iteam costed!</p>
