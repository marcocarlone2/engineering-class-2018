<p>The Mayfield High School football coaches sent our Enigneering class a data sheet, which consists of all the plays and results of the upcoming team that we are playing. So after we get this data we open it in Excell and explore with different functions like the Pivot Table. Finally, after we do that we collect all the information that we saw and send it to the coaches to use with the defense.</p>
