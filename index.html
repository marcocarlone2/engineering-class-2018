  <p>I have played many sports, but baseball has been the one I stuck with. I've played baseball since I was 4 years old, i've played reck, travel, fall ball, and school ball which I still continue to do. I hope to keep playing baseball in the future.</p>

Also, i've taken plenty of elctives in the Art, Tech, and Communications departments. I am able to make this website now because of the education i've recieved here in the High School, I love it here!</p>
