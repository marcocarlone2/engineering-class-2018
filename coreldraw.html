<p>Corel Draw is a function that has many ways to design shapes. We were able to create shapes or take them from to web. After that, we were able to take our designs and load them onto a Flash Drive to which we used the Vinyl Cutter and Laser Cutter to print out these designs so we can see them in real life!</p>
